# Origin
The origin story of this workshop has a Booster conference flavor.

In 2023 I participated in Einar Host Functional Fish workshop.
During the workshop, which recreates Eschers Square Limit, we came to discuss
other of Eschers art.
The question was raised if it would be possible to apply the ideas of functional
geometry to Escher Circle Limit.

The natural geometry of Circle Limit is different then that of Square Limit.
It is situated in _hyperbolic geometry_. Having studied mathematics Einar and I
agreed to see what it takes to recreate Circle Limit with the goal of
creating a workshop.

I started to study _hyperbolic geometry_ and came across the book
"Crocheting adventures with hyperbolic planes", which offered a tactile aspect
on understanding hyperbolic geometry

I took up crocheting to better understand hyperbolic geometry and instantly fell
in love. Crocheting is a wholesome, tactile activity that is places you in the moment.
It is this love that I would like to share with you.
And how better to do that then by expressing an interest.
