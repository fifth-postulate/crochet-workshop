# Practice makes perfect
as the saying goes.

In this part there are a few small projects that will hone your skills.

The focus will be on technical mastery, more than creativity. Here you can
experiment with thread tension, your single, double and triple crochets and form
that magic ring in small practice projects.

If this sounds strange to your ears, take a look at the tools. Otherwise, don
your practice cap and head over to the first practice project.
