# Circle
The circle project is meant to teach you the value counting stitches.

## Pattern

Any color yarn, hook 4.5mm

```plain
1) mr, sc 6 in mr (6)
2) in 6 (12)
3) (sc, in) 6 (18)
4) (sc 2, in) 6 (24)
5) (sc 3, in) 6 (30)
```

You might have picked up on the pattern. For each row there is an extra single
crochet. This way the number of stitches grows linearly. Which is necessary for
the circle to stay flat.

## Usage
The circle, when finished, can be used as a coaster.

A lot of projects start of with a circle as a base.
