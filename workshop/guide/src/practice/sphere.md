# Sphere
The sphere is the practice project that resembles crocheting a amigurumi the closest.
In fact, a lot of amigurumi are designed by stitching together parts that in a sense
are elaborate molded spheres.

## Pattern

Any color yarn, hook 4.5mm

```plain
1) mr, sc 6 in mr (6)
2) in 6 (12)
3) (sc, in) 6 (18)
4) (sc 2, in) 6 (24)
5) (sc 3, in) 6 (30)
6-8) sc 30 (30)
9) (sc 3, dec) 6 (24)
10) (sc 2, dec) 6 (18)

stuff liberally

11) (sc, dec) 6 (12)
12) dc 6 (6)

cut sufficient yarn to close project. 
```

Close the project by threading the remaining yarn through the front loops of the
six stitches and tightening. Hide the tail in the project.

## Usage
This is the ultimate preparation for creating your mascot. Working from a magic
ring and increasing and decreasing stitches in the right place will mold your
amigurumi just right.

The sphere itself can be used as a stress toy or juggling ball.
