# Square
Making a square is ideal to practice making your single crochet.
Play with your tention and see what difference it makes.

Feel free to to rip your stitches out when done, an act called frogging.
Or if you are really attached to your square. Practice finalizing your project.

## Pattern

Any color yarn, hook 4.5mm


```plain
1) slst, ch 11 (11)
2) sc 1 2nd stitch from hook, sc 9 (10)
3-n) ch 1, turn, sc 10 (10) 
```

You can repeat row 3 as many times until you achieve the desired dimensions.

## Usage
Although the square is a humble project, it often is used to gauge your relation
to the yarn. Everybody uses different tention. If you follow a pattern
and it calls for certain measurements, you can make a test square to relate the
measurements of the project to your own test square.
