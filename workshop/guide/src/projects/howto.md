# How To
At this point you have learned about, and practiced crochet. It is time to move
on to a complete project.

In this part of the workbook there are several crochet projects that create a
language- or tool-mascot.

Flip through the various options and if you see something that you like, start
working on it. If something is unclear, use the tool section to refresh your
memory. And if you are stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help. That is what a
group of crocheters is for.
